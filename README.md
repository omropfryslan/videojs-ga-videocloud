# videojs-ga-videocloud

Google Analytics plugin for the next generation Brightcove player. Note this is not compatible with the Brightcove Smart Player which uses a different plugin architecture and API.

This plugin was forked from the video.js plugin [videojs.ga](https://github.com/mickey/videojs-ga). Main changes from the original:

- The video ID and name are read from the player and tracked as the event label
- If the player is in an iframe embed or loaded directly on `(preview-)players.brightcove.net` *and* a tracker is set in the plugin options, the Google universal analytics script will be loaded by the plugin. If the in page embed is used Google Analytics must be separately loaded on the page before the player, as with the original videojs-ga.
- Event names tracked are those used by the Smart Player plugins, where applicable. Event names can be customised / localised with plugin options.

## Getting Started
* Download the plugin and place on your server.
* Edit the player configuration in the [player studio](https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/players).
* Under _Plugins>JavaScript_, add the URL to the plugin to the player configuration and click +.
* Under _Plugins>Name, Options (JSON)_, enter `ga` as the name and click +.

If you want to use the in-page embed only, this is enough, but you must ensure that Google Analytics is loaded on the page **before** the player.

If you want use the iframe embed or direct player link, you need to also add the tracker to the plugin configuration under _Plugins>Name, Options (JSON)_:

```json
{
    "tracker": "UA-1234567-8"
}
```

### Configuration with the Player Management API

You can configure the plugin with the [player management API](http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/index.html) instead of the GUI studio. For example, to add the plugin to an existing player:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --user $EMAIL --request PATCH --data '{"scripts":["http://example.com/videojs.ga.videocloud.js"],"plugins":[{"name":"ga","options":{"tracker":"UA-1234567-8","eventNames":{"play":"Wiedergabe"}}}]}' https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/configuration
```

## Options

Provide options to the plugin in the player configuraiton using `ga` as the name.

```json
{
  "tracker": "UA-1234567-8",
  "eventNames": {
    "play": "Wiedergabe"
  }
}
```

#### ga.js and analytics.js

If the in-page embed is used, this plugin supports the ga.js and the newer analytics.js Google Analytics libraries. It autodetects the library you use.

If the iframe embed or direct player URL is used, and a tracker is provided, the "universal" analytics.js is loaded.
